            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer
                 battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean
                  video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan
                   "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and
                    expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one
                     hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill
                      others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's
                       map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force
                        encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.<br><br>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near future.
                 Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world.
                  In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five
                   players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that
                    requires charging through kills, deaths, or spike actions. Every player starts each round with a "classic"
                     pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased 
                     using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills
                      the player is responsible for, and any actions taken with the spike. The game has an assortment of weapons
                       including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns,
                        assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a
                         unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot 
                         accurately.Different agents allow players to find more ways to plant the Spike and
                          style on enemies with scrappers, strategists, and hunters of every description. It
                           currently offers 15 agents to choose from.They are Brimstone, Phoenix, Sage, Sova, Viper, Cypher,
                            Reyna, Killjoy, Breach, Omen, Jett, Raze, Skye, Yoru, and Astra.</p><br><br>
